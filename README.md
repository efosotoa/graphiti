## üìñ Introduction

Knowledge graphs are essential for AI agents to understand and interpret complex data. They help in connecting disparate pieces of information, enabling AI systems to make informed decisions. Graphiti simplifies the process of building these graphs in real-time, ensuring that your AI agents are always equipped with the most current data.

## üåü Features

- **Real-Time Updates**: Automatically refresh your knowledge graphs as new data becomes available.
- **Scalability**: Handle large datasets without compromising performance.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive design for easy navigation and management of your graphs.
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with various AI frameworks and tools.
- **Support for Multiple Data Sources**: Pull data from various APIs, databases, and more.
- **Graph Visualization**: Built-in tools to visualize your graphs for better understanding.

   ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

Once you have installed Graphiti, you can start building your knowledge graphs. Here‚Äôs a simple example to get you started:

1. **Creating a New Graph**:
   You can create a new graph by sending a request to the API:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/graphs -d '{"name": "MyGraph"}'
   ```

2. **Adding Nodes and Edges**:
   To add nodes and edges to your graph, use the following commands:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/graphs/MyGraph/nodes -d '{"label": "Node1"}'
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/graphs/MyGraph/edges -d '{"source": "Node1", "target": "Node2"}'
   ```

3. **Visualizing the Graph**:
   Access the visualization tool at `http://localhost:5000/visualize` to see your graph in action.
